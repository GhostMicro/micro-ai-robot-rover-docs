# 🤖 Ghost Micro - Commander Dashboard Guide

Welcome to the **Ghost Micro Commander Interface (v3.0)**. This guide explains how to operate the dual-control system using the PC Dashboard and the interactive OLED UI.

### 1. Manual Keyboard Control (8 Keys Total)
You have full control using **8 active keys**:

#### Movement (Drive & Cancel Action)
- **[W]**: Move Forward
- **[S]**: Move Backward
- **[A]**: Turn Left
- **[D]**: Turn Right
*(Pressing any WASD key immediately cancels any active Action/Dance)*

#### Action Triggers (1-4)
- **[1]**: **Square Step** (Walks in a box shape)
- **[2]**: **Zig Zag** (Moves forward in a zigzag pattern)
- **[3]**: **Shake** (Shakes left and right in place)
- **[4]**: **Slow Spiral** (Drives in a widening circle)

### 2. Dual-Source Logic
The system intelligently switches between inputs:
- **PC Priority**: As long as the Dashboard is open, it takes priority over the physical Joystick.
- **Joystick Fallback**: If the PC is inactive for >2 seconds, the physical hardware joystick is re-enabled.
